## 🚀 My Cybersecurity Learning Path

After serving eight years in the military, I decided to transition into cybersecurity and began by earning my **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity** from **Southern New Hampshire University**. While the degree program provided a solid foundation in networking and security concepts, I quickly realized that reading and writing papers wasn’t enough to become truly skilled in the field.

To gain hands-on experience, I started pursuing certifications alongside my degree. My first was the

from TCM Security, which gave me my first real exposure to ethical hacking and penetration testing.

From there, I continued expanding my knowledge base:
- **CompTIA Security+** – foundational understanding of cybersecurity principles and frameworks

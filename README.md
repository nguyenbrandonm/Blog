# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a centralized place to reflect on my cybersecurity education. Each certification, course, and degree will have its own dedicated write-up, covering what I learned, how I approached it, and the skills I developed along the way.

It’s both a personal record of progress and a resource for others interested in following a similar learning path into cybersecurity.
